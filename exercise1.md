For maintaining code quality and adherence to coding standards, web projects commonly leverage tools like ESlint. The tool analyzes the codebase, highlighting deviations from established conventions and identifying potential issues, by comparing the written code to configured preferences.

Testing is integral to the CI pipeline, and React developers frequently turn to jest or cypress libraries for their simplicity and flexibility. Paired with jest's coverage tool, these libraries not only facilitate comprehensive testing but also provide insights into code coverage, a crucial metric in gauging test effectiveness.

While JavaScript, being an JIT language, does not involve explicit compilation, the building step may encompass tasks like packaging the application. Here, tools such as webpack come into play, streamlining the packaging process for distribution. If the project is written in TypeScript, a separate transpilation process must be done before the code can be packaged up.

Beyond the widely adopted Jenkins and GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD is probably the most used pipeline tool. GitLab offers an integrated CI/CD platform seamlessly integrated with Git repositories, providing a unified environment for version control and CI processes. Other noteworthy alternatives include Travis CI, CircleCI, and Bitbucket Pipelines, each offering unique features and integrations.

As mentioned in the material, self-hosting provides a higher degree of control over the CI infrastructure. This is particularly beneficial for organizations with specific infrastructure requirements or stringent security protocols. Additionally, customization becomes more accessible, allowing teams to tailor the CI environment to the unique needs of their projects.

Then again cloud-based CI solutions offer unparalleled scalability, making them ideal for projects with fluctuating workloads. Maintenance becomes a non-issue as cloud providers handle infrastructure upkeep, freeing up development teams to focus on code rather than infrastructure. Seamless integration with cloud repositories and other services is an added advantage.

For this specific project the best option would probably be a cloud-based solution as the development team is quite small and the project size will probably be manageable as well.
